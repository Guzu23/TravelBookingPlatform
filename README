The project's goal is to mimic a Travel Booking Platform. This is done by implementing a variety of controllers in swagger. You can add/read/update/delete all 5 tables from the database.

The run process is pretty straightforward:
1. Go to MyDbContext.cs and change _windowsConnectionString to your own ConnectionString that you use to connect to your database(Preferably the database to be clean).
2. Go into Package Manager Console and run "Update-Database"
3. Compile and run.

The points achieved are checked with a red mark in the ("[Final Project] Requirements.pdf") file.




V2: Things implemented/fixed:

- The code structure got fixed:
	- Some services got implemented;
	- The logic from controllers was moved in BusinessLayer in services;
	- The project no longer uses MyDbContext. It now uses IRepository;
	- The controllers are now cleaner;
	- Some useless libraries got removed;
	- The project structure is cleaner(There are no more 100000000000000 folders for each class).
- Strategy Pattern got implemented;
- A dummy Blazor WebAPI got implemented. It only shows the basic Hello World.
