The project's goal is to mimic a Travel Booking Platform. This is done by implementing a variety of controllers in swagger. You can add/read/update/delete all 5 tables from the database.

The run process is pretty straightforward:
1. Go to MyDbContext.cs and change _windowsConnectionString to your own ConnectionString that you use to connect to your database(Preferably the database to be clean).
2. Go into Package Manager Console and run "Update-Database"
3. Compile and run.

The points achieved are checked with a red mark in the ("[Final Project] Requirements.pdf") file.
